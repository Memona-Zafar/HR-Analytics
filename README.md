HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI

Objective

This project aims to help organizations improve employee performance and retention (reduce attrition) by developing an HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI. The dashboard provides key insights into employee attrition, salary distribution, job roles, education levels, and other critical factors that influence retention.

Features:
Attrition Rate Analysis: Displays the overall attrition rate and count of employees who have left.
Employee Demographics: Insights into attrition based on age groups, gender, and education levels.
Salary Distribution: Understanding the impact of salary slabs on attrition.
Job Role Insights: Breakdown of attrition by different job roles and departments.
Years at Company: Analysis of how employee tenure affects attrition.
Interactive Visuals: Dynamic and interactive Power BI visuals to explore trends and patterns.
Technologies Used:
Power BI Desktop: For data visualization and interactive reporting.
Data Modeling: To structure and clean HR data.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for calculations and measures.
Excel/CSV: Data sources used for analysis.

Insights & Key Findings:
The overall attrition rate is 16.1%, affecting 237 employees out of 1470.
Employees with lower salaries (â‰¤ 5K) have the highest attrition rate.
Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists show the highest turnover.
The 26-35 age group has the highest number of employees leaving.
HR and Research & Development departments face significant attrition.

How Organizations Can Solve the Employee Attrition Problem

To reduce attrition and improve employee retention, organizations can take the following strategic steps based on the insights from the HR Analytics Dashboard:

1. Competitive Compensation & Benefits
Ensure fair and competitive salaries based on industry benchmarks.
Introduce performance-based incentives and bonuses to boost employee motivation.
Offer better benefits like health insurance, wellness programs, and retirement plans.
2. Career Growth & Development
Provide training programs and skill development opportunities for employees.

Offer mentorship programs to guide employees in their professional growth.
3. Improve Work-Life Balance
Promote flexible work arrangements such as hybrid work models and remote work options.

Recognize and reward employees for their contributions and achievements.
5. Strong Leadership & Management
Train managers to be supportive leaders rather than just supervisors.

Encourage open communication between employees and management.
6. Address Key Attrition Areas
Identify departments or job roles with high attrition rates and investigate underlying causes.
Offer role-specific benefits to employees in departments with high turnover.
Improve working conditions for job roles that show frequent resignations.
7. Diversity, Inclusion & Workplace Culture
Promote a diverse and inclusive workplace where employees feel valued.
Establish anti-discrimination policies and a respectful work environment.
Create employee resource groups (ERGs) for underrepresented employees.
8. Data-Driven HR Decisions
Continuously monitor HR analytics dashboards for real-time insights.
Use predictive analytics to foresee potential attrition risks and take preventive actions.
Implement AI-driven employee retention strategies to address problem areas.


By implementing these solutions, organizations can reduce attrition, improve employee satisfaction, and create a more stable and productive workforce. ðŸš€
